                <h2>Mars Exploration Program</h2>
                <p>The goal of the Mars Exploration Program is to explore Mars and to provide a continuous flow of scientific information and discovery through a carefully selected series of robotic orbiters, landers and mobile laboratories interconnected by a high-bandwidth Mars/Earth communications network.</p>
                <h2>Why Mars?</h2>
                <p>There are several strategic, practical and scientific reasons for humans to explore Mars. Among them we know that Mars is the most accessible place in the solar system. Additionally, exploring Mars provides the opportunity to possibly answer origin and evolution of life questions, and could someday be a destination for survival of humankind.</p>
                <p>In the strategic sense, exploring Mars demonstrates our political and economic leadership as a nation, improves the quality of life on Earth, helps us learn about our home planet, and expands US leadership in the peaceful, international exploration of space.</p>

                   <h2>PLANETARY RESOURCES</h2>
                   <p>In anticipation of someday sending humans to Mars, NASA has begun searching for suitable locations for humans to land. The agency is looking for locations of high scientific value that would also provide resources to allow human explorers to land, live, and work on Mars.  Locally derived natural resources such as water and oxygen are crucial for humans to explore Mars.</p>
                   <p>Liquid water could be potentially be extracted from ground ice (at or buried beneath the surface), the atmosphere or hydrated minerals.  Oxygen can be generated from the carbon dioxide that makes up most of Mars' atmosphere. The Mars 2023 rover mission will include an instrument (MOXIE) to demonstrate the technology for oxygen generation.</p>

                    <h2>RESEARCH PROGRAMS</h2>
                    <p>Scientific research to increase our knowledge of Mars as a planetary system is a key activity that NASA funds. The primary mechanism for providing this funding is what is known as Research and Analysis (R&A) programs. Scientists from all over the United States (university professors, NASA center researchers, etc.) submit research grant proposals to these programs. The proposals are peer reviewed and selected for funding based on the quality of science.</p>
                    <p>The dedicated Mars research program is the Mars Data Analysis Program (MDAP). The goal of MDAP is to enhance the scientific return of data collected during Mars missions. Data used in the program must be publicly available 30 days before the proposal submission deadline. Currently there are 108 active grants and 10 active NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowships (NESSF) for graduate students.</p>

                <h2>TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
                <p>The Mars Exploration Program invests in its own Mars-relevant technologies, as well as staying abreast of complementary innovations across NASA and the Aerospace industry. Technology investments unique to Mars include:</p>
                <h3>● Mars Ascent Vehicle:</h3>
                <p>An essential element if NASA is ever to return materials (or people) from Mars, NASA’s Mars Exploration Program is currently investing in propulsion & guidance technology that could survive the trip to Mars and its harsh surface environments before being launched back into space. Hybrid rocket motors using paraffin fuel burned with liquid oxides of nitrogen are especially promising for this application. Within the thin Mars atmosphere, aerodynamic controls such as fins will not be effective, so investments are also being made in Liquid Injection Thrust Vector Control (LITVC). Using small ports to inject liquid oxidizer directly into the nozzle at different points, the direction of the MAV can be controlled quickly and effectively with no moving parts, even in the thin atmosphere on Mars.</p>
                <h3>● Planetary Protection Technologies:</h3>
                <p>NASA’s Mars Exploration Program is also investing in technologies to enable the safe transport of materials from Mars to Earth (e.g., technologies for containing samples and sample containers for Mars materials, as well as technologies for sterilizing the outsides of these containers). Although it is not known whether or not life ever existed on Mars, concept studies for returning Martian material are conducted under safety standards that are as high as, or higher than, standards used for transporting known  hazardous material on Earth. Technologies currently under investigation include in-space sterilization approaches (e.g., localized heat sterilization and plasma sterilization), as well as sealing technologies (e.g., in-space metal brazing and explosive welding).</p>
